# Density based cluster methods:
#     - Density peaks
#     - DBSCAN
#     - Jarvis Patrick
#     - Shared nearest neighbors

# G Mancini, September 2019

# a scikit.learn KDTree should be used but it does not
# take precomputed distances
# btw you can pass the SNN graph to sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN
# with metric=precomputed
